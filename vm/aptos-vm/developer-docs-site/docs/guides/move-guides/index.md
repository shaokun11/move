# Write Smart Contracts with Move

To efficiently write smart contracts in Aptos, we recommend you first:

1. Learn Move concepts
1. Understand Aptos security
1. Create a collection
1. Create an NFT
1. Create resource account

## Aptos Move guides

Start here to learn how the Move language works on the Aptos blockchain.

- ### [Interact with the Move VM](../interacting-with-the-blockchain.md)
- ### [Your First Move module](../../tutorials/first-move-module.md)
- ### [Mint NFT with Aptos CLI](./mint-nft-cli.md)

## Aptos Move reference

Then review our auto-generated contents for more [Move References](../../reference/move.md).

## Move tools

Use these tools to enhance your Move development experience.

### Aptos CLI

The [Aptos command line interface](../../cli-tools/aptos-cli-tool/index.md) (CLI) helps you test development, as many of the functions in our SDKs have corresponding commands.


### Petra Wallet

Although you may use any wallet developed for Aptos, the documents here reflect Petra Wallet. We recommend [installing](../../guides/install-petra-wallet.md) and [using](https://petra.app/docs/petra-intro) it.


### Aptos Simulation API

Use the [Aptos Simulation API](../../concepts/gas-txn-fee.md#estimating-the-gas-units-via-simulation) to test your apps, understanding the blockchain is in an ever-changing state. For example, an auction where people are selling, bidding, and buying will return varying results second by second. Gambling apps may generate wildly different results in a short time. So depending upon your application, you should expect some randomness. So guard your users by keeping simulations realistic.


### Move Prover

Install the [Move Prover](../../cli-tools/install-move-prover.md) dependencies after installing the Aptos CLI If you want to use the Move Prover to validate your Move code.


### IDEs for Move

Install the [IDE plugins for the Move language](../../guides/getting-started.md#ide-plugins-for-move-language) for even more handy features.
